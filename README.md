Creating a Wordle-like game in Vanilla JS, HTML &amp; CSS

The recording below shows the function of the game properly handling a few different scenarios when playing such a game. Properly filling in each cell with their respective background color for each guess and handling improper inputs were considered when building this light-weight game.

Hope you enjoy!
